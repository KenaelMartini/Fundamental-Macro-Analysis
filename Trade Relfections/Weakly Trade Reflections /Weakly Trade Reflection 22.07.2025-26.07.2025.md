## 🔹 Key Event of the Week:
- One position taken on EUR/JPY, fully aligned with macro bias and executed post-catalyst.
- Trade reached a maximum unrealized profit of +3%, but was exited early due to a premature SL adjustment.
- Execution was clean until exit, which revealed a remaining emotional bias to protect PnL.

---

## 🔹 Drawdown Recovery Update:
- **Previous Max Drawdown (pre-July):** **-5.6%**
- **Current Drawdown:** **0% (Break-even)**
- This week marks a full recovery of account equity, closing the drawdown built over the past 1.5 months.
- This is a **significant step forward**, achieved with patience and respect of structure.
- The remaining weakness lies in exit execution — not in the thesis or entry.

---

## 🔹 Market Conditions Summary:
- **Macro Environment:** Eurozone PMI surprised to the upside, and the ECB press conference was slightly more hawkish than expected.
- **JPY context:** Strength overvalued pre-catalyst due to institutional caution — later corrected.
- **Volatility:** Low at the start of the week, concentration of catalysts on Thursday.
- **Opportunity Clarity:** One clean setup, no forcing after execution.

---

## 🔹 Decisions Taken:
- Trade taken only **after confirmation of all data releases** and a proper M15 structure.
- No additional trades executed despite recovery — discipline maintained.
- Conscious **decision to stop for the week** after execution to protect capital and performance.
- No trading planned next week due to vacation — this was the **final position of July**.

---

## 🔹 What Went Well:
✅ Recovery from drawdown without overtrading.  
✅ High-quality macro/technical alignment.  
✅ Entry was clean and followed plan strictly.  
✅ No revenge trading or emotional impulse post-trade.  
✅ Professional attitude: closed the month solidly and stepped back intentionally.

---

## 🔹 What Can Be Improved:
⚠️ Stop-loss management: no adjustments unless structural invalidation confirmed.  
⚠️ Exit discipline must match the precision of the entry.  
⚠️ Emotional residue post-drawdown impacted trade management — to eliminate.

## 🔹 Trader's Reflection (Mindset):
> **"This trade was more than just a position.  
> It was a psychological pivot — a shift from drawdown to control.  
> I didn’t overreact, I didn’t chase, I didn’t force.  
> I followed my thesis, traded my edge, and learned the cost of breaking discipline.  
> The capital is recovered. The lesson is paid for. The focus now is on mastery, not redemption."**

---

## 🔹 Outlook for Next Week:
- No trading next week (vacation from July 28th to August 2nd).
- Full market re-entry planned for **Monday, August 4th**.
- A complete reset will be done during the weekend of **August 2–3** to update all macro sheets, market context, and prepare the fundamental watchlist.
- **Focus for August:** Exit execution, structural SL only, strict capital discipline, and no emotional interference.
