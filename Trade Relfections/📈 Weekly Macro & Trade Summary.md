## 📈 Weekly Macro & Trade Summary  
**Monday 28 July – Saturday 2 August 2025**

### 🌍 1. EU–US Trade Agreement: Junction of Risk & Respite
On 27–28 July, U.S. President Trump and European Commission President von der Leyen secured a **framework trade deal**:
- **15% U.S. tariff** imposed on most EU imports, including autos, semiconductors, and pharmaceuticals — a sharp increase from ~3% pre-2025, but half of the initially threatened 30% rate
- **Steel and aluminum tariffs remain at 50%**, excluded from the agreement’s scope.
- EU pledges up to **$600 bn in private-sector investment** into the U.S. by 2028, with no public budget funding involved.
- EU commits to purchasing **$750 bn of U.S. energy products** (oil, LNG, nuclear fuel) over three years — critics label this target logistically unrealistic.

### 🏦 2. U.S. Fed: Patience Amid Pressure
The **Federal Reserve kept rates steady at 4.25%–4.50%** for the fifth consecutive meeting. The FOMC vote was **9–2**, with Trump-appointees Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller dissenting in favor of a 25 bp cut. Powell emphasized data dependence and made no commitment to a September easing.

### 🇪🇺 3. Euro Area Inflation Keeps ECB Centered
Eurostat’s **flash estimate for July** confirmed inflation at **2.0% YoY**, unchanged from June. Core inflation (i.e. excluding energy and food) remains close to **2.5%**, aligning with ECB’s steady policy rhetoric.

### 🇨🇳 4. China’s Caixin Manufacturing PMI Slips Sub‑50
July’s **Caixin PMI fell to 49.5**, indicating contraction in factory activity and new export orders — a negative signal for global risk appetite and demand recovery.

### 🇯🇵 5. Japanese Domestic Demand Offers Mild Support  
Japan posted **+2.0% YoY retail sales growth in June**, beating expectations and underscoring some insulating strength in local consumer spending despite external trade headwinds.

### 📊 6. Asset Classes: U.S. Calm vs European Friction  
| Market | Performance | Key Driver |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| **U.S. Equities (S&P 500 / Nasdaq)** | All‑time closes in early week; modest pullback later | Strong Q2 earnings and sigh of relief over trade accord|
| **European Stocks (STOXX 600, CAC, DAX)** | Fell to week‑lows by Friday | Tariff exposure for exporters, poor corporate earnings in automotive and beverage sectors|

### 🔍 7. Investment Themes: Divergence vs Continuity
- **U.S. markets showed resilience**, leveraging trade de-escalation and resilient earnings, while investors recalibrated Fed rate-cut expectations.
- **Europe’s equity narrative turned tougher**, as the 15% tariffs and uncertain delivery of energy and investment pledges weighed on investor sentiment.
- **Policy divergence widens**: Fed signals prolonged tightness, ECB remains steady, and Asian central banks remain reactive to moderate inflation and domestic data.
- **Global backdrop fragmented**: stable inflation in Europe; sluggish manufacturing in Asia; mixed consumer activity in Japan — all under the shadow of trade uncertainty.

### ✅ Bottom‑line for the Week
The EU–U.S. deal **averted a headline 30% tariff crisis**, but the new 15% structure still represents a **material shift in transatlantic trade costs**, particularly for exporters. The U.S. market drove modest risk‑on relief pre‑FOMC, but quickly pivoted to skepticism over growth prospects. European markets responded negatively as export tariffs threatened profits and capital flows. Expect continued market scrutiny heading into August data releases: **U.S. non‑farm payrolls**, **ISM surveys**, **ECB minutes**, and **Chinese import/export data** will be crucial.
