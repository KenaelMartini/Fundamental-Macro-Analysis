# 📆 Weekly Trade Reflection  
### Week of July 14th to July 18th, 2025

---

## 🗓️ Today is Thursday.  
I have made the decision to **not take any further positions this week.**

---

## ✅ Reason:
- A very strong performance was achieved on Tuesday: **+4% net on my capital** from a single trade, perfectly executed, fully aligned with my trading plan, my fundamental bias, and my technical framework.
- No exceptional setup identified for the remainder of the week that would justify taking additional risk.
- I know the temptation to **"do more" is a common trap** after a strong performance.
- My objective is **not to be active, but to be consistent and sustainable.**

## 🧠 Trader's Thought:
> **Protecting performance also means protecting capital.**  
> **Knowing when to stop is a skill.**  
> This week, I didn’t just earn **+4%**.  
> I gained **discipline**, **patience**, and moved closer to an **institutional standard**.  
> My work for this week is done.  
> The market will still be there on **Monday**.
