## ðŸ§  About Me  
I am an independent young trader specializing in **fundamental and macroeconomic analysis of currencies**, with a particular focus on:  
- Monetary policies of major central banks (FOMC, ECB, BoE, BoJ, etc.)  
- Key macroeconomic indicators (CPI, Core CPI, PPI, PMIâ€¦)  
- Analysis of money flows, market sentiment, and bond markets  
- Correlations between currencies, interest rates, and macroeconomic trends  
- Monitoring speculative positioning and global sentiment (CFTC, CME FedWatch)  

I also develop **small custom Python programs tailored to my needs to automate repetitive tasks and optimize my data collection and visualization for macroeconomic analysis.**

My goal is to **combine advanced macroeconomic expertise with modern tools** (Python, data scraping, dashboards) to build efficient and robust decision-making frameworks.
