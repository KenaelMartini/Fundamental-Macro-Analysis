## üìâ Overview: Unexplained USD/JPY Drop

Since **Monday, July 22**, USD/JPY has dropped by nearly **1.7%**, despite **no major economic catalyst** in Japan.  
This sudden appreciation of the JPY lacks fundamental backing and appears to be driven by **short-term defensive positioning**.

## üîç Institutional Interpretation

### ‚úÖ Pre-data Hedging Behavior
- With **high-risk macro events** scheduled for **Thursday (July 25)** ‚Äî including:
  - EUR/GBP/USD Flash PMIs  
  - ECB Rate Decision  
  - US Jobless Claims  
‚Üí Institutions are **reducing risk** and rotating into **safe-haven assets** like the JPY.

### ‚ùó Contradiction: Market Is Risk ON

> üìà **Fear & Greed Index: 74** ‚Üí clear signal of a **Risk ON** environment.
