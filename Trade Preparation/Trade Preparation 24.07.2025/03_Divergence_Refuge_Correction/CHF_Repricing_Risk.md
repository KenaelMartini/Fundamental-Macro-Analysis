# üá®üá≠ CHF Repricing ‚Äì Defensive Rally & SNB Risk

---

## üìâ Overview: Unjustified USD/CHF Drop

Since **Monday, July 22**, **USD/CHF has dropped ~1.4%**, without any significant CHF-supportive macro data.  
This move appears to be part of a **broader risk-off rotation** into safe-haven assets such as the Swiss franc (CHF), not driven by fundamentals.

## üîç Institutional Interpretation

### ‚úÖ Defensive Flow into CHF

- Investors are hedging macro risk ahead of **Thursday, July 25**:
  - EUR/GBP/USD PMIs  
  - ECB rate decision  
  - US Jobless Claims  
- In the absence of data, CHF attracts **defensive inflows** as a traditional safe-haven asset.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è But Risk Sentiment Is Risk-ON

Despite defensive positioning, broader **risk sentiment is actually bullish**:

> üìà **Fear & Greed Index** stands at **74** ‚Üí Clear confirmation of **Risk ON** environment.

This supports the idea that the CHF rally is **contrarian and unstable**, and could quickly unwind if macro data aligns with the bullish sentiment.
