## ðŸŽ¯ Strategy Implications

1. **JPY could strengthen** if inflation news remains strong and trade uncertainty diminishesâ€”look for moves around **JPY crosses (USD/JPY, EUR/JPY)**.  
2. A continued cautious tone, or new trade tensions, could trigger swoons in JPYâ€”capitalise on **short JPY upside** (long USD/JPY).  
3. Technical analysis in `USDJPY.md` & `EURJPY.md` should account for **spikes and retracements** aligned with BoJ sentiment shifts, inflation datapoints, and trade headlines.
