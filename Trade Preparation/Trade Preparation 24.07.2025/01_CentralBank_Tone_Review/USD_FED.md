## 🎯 Strategic Implications

1. **USD likely to stay strong** into Thursday data – no dovish surprise expected pre-July FOMC.
2. **Positive US data surprise** (jobless claims or PMIs) could reinforce USD bullishness ahead of September pricing shift.
3. **Post-Thursday surge in USD momentum** could trigger snapbacks in CHF/JPY; monitor for reversal setups.
4. `USDCHF.md` and `USDJPY.md` must include resistances alignable with potential USD strength.
