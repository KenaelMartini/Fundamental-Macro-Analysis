# 📘 Trade Preparation – Thursday, July 25th, 2025

## 🧠 Macro Context & Project Rationale

This trading week revolves around one major macroeconomic event:  
**Thursday, July 25th** — a day packed with high-impact data releases:

- 🇪🇺 Flash PMIs (France, Germany, Eurozone)
- 🇬🇧 UK Flash PMIs
- 🇺🇸 US Jobless Claims + Flash PMIs
- 🇪🇺 ECB Rate Decision + Christine Lagarde’s press conference

## ⏳ Why no positions were taken earlier this week

Early-week price action has been **irrational and decoupled from macro fundamentals**.  
This reflects a classic institutional behavior seen ahead of major macro days:

> 💬 *“No large bank or institution deploys serious capital right before such an unpredictable session.”*

As a result:
- 📉 Price moves are driven by **hedging**, **profit-taking**, or **defensive speculation**
- ❌ They don’t reflect the underlying macro reality
- 🎯 Our approach is to **wait for the data to trigger a rational repricing** and then strike

## 🎯 Project Objectives

This repository aims to:

1. **Assess central bank tone** via recent speeches (hawkish / dovish)
2. **Map out fundamental scenarios** for each key data release (PMIs, jobless claims, ECB)
3. **Identify overbought “safety” currencies** like CHF and JPY that may be mispriced
4. **Build executable trading plans** that align macro, sentiment, and technical structure
5. **Document the full institutional-grade process** from research to execution

## 📌 Why this matters

In a market where **noise often precedes information**, this repo is our structured response:  
> *“Let the data speak, then ride the repricing.”*
