---

## 🚨 Key Scenarios Based on Likely Tone

### 1. **Hawkish**
- **Drivers**: Strong morning PMIs + caution over recent euro strength
- **Market Impact**: EUR surges, particularly vs. CHF, JPY, and GBP — rapid spikes likely
- **ECB Signal**: Warnings of currency drag on inflation; may hint at preserving optionality to tighten again.

### 2. **Neutral**
- **Drivers**: PMIs meet expectations; euro strength viewed as overbought
- **Market Impact**: EUR consolidates or slides modestly against CHF/JPY
- **ECB Signal**: “Data-dependent” pause continues; pushback on excessive FX-driven volatility.

### 3. **Dovish Surprise**
- **Drivers**: PMIs weaker-than-expected or shifts in tone
- **Market Impact**: EUR drops sharply; caught markets unprepared — fast downside squeeze possible
- **ECB Signal**: Minor tone shift toward easing bias; aggressive dovish surprise could follow if trade risks escalate.

## 📌 Strategy & Execution Plan

- **Execution window**: 14:15–15:00 CET (after statement)
- **Watchlists**: EURCHF, EURJPY, EURGBP — watch for momentum trades triggered off ECB tone
- **Layered approach**: Breakout or reversal setups based on tone scenario; align with earlier PMI move

## 🔗 Context & Key Sources

- Strong tariffs and euro appreciation cited as reasons for pause, though currency gains near $1.20 may be a concern. 
- Policymakers (e.g. Kazaks, de Guindos) warn about overvalued euro and need to maintain optionality — suggesting pause but readiness to cut if FX undermines inflation.
- Market firmly pricing a July pause, with September–December cuts still anticipated.
