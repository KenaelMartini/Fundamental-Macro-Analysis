- **Forecast**: 221K

## 🔄 Market Reaction Filter: T-Notes 2Y & DXY

To validate the quality of the data release, watch:

### 📉 T-Notes 2Y (US 2-Year Yield)
- **If jobless claims are lower than expected** → yields rise → hawkish signal → USD strengthens
- **If jobless claims are higher than expected** → yields fall → dovish signal → USD weakens

### 💵 DXY (US Dollar Index)
- **If strong data** → DXY rises → confirms USD strength
- **If weak data** → DXY falls → confirms bearish USD

Both T-Note and DXY need to **confirm the direction** of the USD before entering a trade.

## ✅ Execution Guidelines

| Principle                       | Action                                 |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Focus on fundamental catalyst  | Trade only if the surprise is clear    |
| Confirm with T-Note 2Y & DXY   | Both must react in the same direction  |
| Do not overlap GBP/CHF & USD/JPY | Only trade one event at a time        |
| No trade = strong decision     | Skip marginal setups without hesitation |

---

## 🔚 Summary

- This is a **reaction-based trade**, not a forecast-based one.
- You are not trading the number, but the **market's repricing of rates via bonds and DXY**.
- Be patient, and if the surprise is clear, act decisively with confirmation from yields and sentiment.
