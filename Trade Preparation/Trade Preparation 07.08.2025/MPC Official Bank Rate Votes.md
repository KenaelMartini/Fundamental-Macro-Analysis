# 📊 Trade Plan — BoE Monetary Policy Event (August 7th, 2025)

---

## 🔍 Context Overview

### GBP (British Pound)
- Macro bias: neutral to slightly dovish
- Inflation declining, but services inflation still sticky
- MPC (Monetary Policy Committee) remains cautious
- Market partially pricing in a 25 bps rate cut → room for hawkish surprise

### CHF (Swiss Franc)
- Fundamentally weak:
  - SNB already in an easing cycle
  - No signs of hawkish pivot
  - Structural underperformance in current macro landscape

➡️ GBP/CHF selected as the optimal pair to express a directional bias

## 🧠 Notes

- GBP/JPY excluded due to excessive volatility and bidirectional reaction risk.
- Focus on asymmetry: GBP could surprise hawkishly vs CHF’s structural weakness.
- Patience is key: avoid front-running the decision. **You are not trading the surprise — you’re trading the market’s *reaction to the pricing* of the surprise.**
