# 📈 USD/JPY Analysis – August 5, 2025

## 🧠 General Context

Over the past two weeks, USD/JPY has experienced a steady and justified uptrend. This bullish move was supported by:

- Strong performance of the U.S. economy,
- Robust macroeconomic data (inflation, consumption, employment),
- A still highly accommodative monetary policy from the Bank of Japan.

I was able to capitalize on this bullish momentum under well-aligned market conditions.

## ⚠️ End-of-Week Reflection

Heading into the end of last week, I began to see signs that **USD/JPY was overvalued**:

- The price had risen sharply with very little correction,
- Momentum indicators showed signs of exhaustion,
- The market seemed over-positioned long on the dollar.

As a result, I **chose not to enter new long positions** despite the prevailing uptrend, out of caution.

## 📉 Friday’s Correction (Post-NFP)

On Friday, the market corrected sharply following **weaker-than-expected U.S. employment data** (NFP). This release acted as a **catalyst** for a logical profit-taking move, confirming my view that the dollar had been overextended short-term.

> 💬 In my view, the correction was **brutal but healthy**. It doesn’t invalidate the broader bullish trend, but instead serves to **rebalance recent price excess** on USD/JPY.

## 🎯 Current Stance

I now consider the price to have returned to:

- A **more reasonable valuation level**,
- Possibly even slightly undervalued, creating a **more favorable environment for potential long setups**.

I believe that the current context is **better suited for considering USD/JPY longs** — provided that:

- The **price action** confirms a constructive structure (e.g., base, breakout, volume),
- Upcoming **macroeconomic releases** (notably the ISM Service report at 4 PM today) support renewed USD strength.

## 🔜 Next Steps

I will monitor:

1. **Price action development** on lower timeframes (M15 / H1),
2. **Market reaction to the ISM release** this afternoon.

This will allow me to define a **clear trading plan** (entry level, stop-loss, target, invalidation) and possibly re-enter long positions under more rational, rebalanced market conditions.
