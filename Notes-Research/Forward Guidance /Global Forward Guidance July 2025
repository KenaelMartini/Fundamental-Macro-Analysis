# 📄 Forward Guidance FX – July 2025  
### Based on ING FX Research and My Personal Market Analysis

---

## 📌 General Investor Sentiment
According to ING’s latest survey, institutional investors **do not expect a sudden appreciation of the USD towards the end of 2025.**  
This aligns with my personal view: the market has **already priced in the future rate cuts by the Fed**, and these cuts will structurally weigh on the dollar, despite Powell’s current verbal support for a “strong dollar.”

While Powell can defend the USD in the short term through communication, the economic cycle will eventually force him to act. **The upcoming rate cuts will inevitably weaken the dollar.**

The USD remains under tension, however, due to the uncertainty surrounding the US elections, particularly with Donald Trump’s return to the political stage.  
Markets view Trump as **unpredictable**, which keeps investors cautious in the short term despite clearer bearish expectations for the medium term.

## 🛑 If the USD Becomes Risky – Safe Haven Rotation
Should the USD be perceived as **structurally more risky**, capital flows are likely to rotate towards the following currencies:

| Rank | Currency | Reason                                                   |
|------|----------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| 1️⃣   | CHF      | Ultimate safe haven, protected by external surplus        |
| 2️⃣   | EUR      | Hybrid profile, second largest global economy, attractive assets |
| 3️⃣   | JPY      | Traditional safe haven, but lagging due to BoJ policy      |

It is particularly interesting to note that the **Japanese Yen**, historically considered the leading safe haven, now ranks **third behind the euro.**  
The EUR benefits from its hybrid status between risk-on and risk-off assets and its structural weight as the **second-largest global economy.**

## 🇯🇵 JPY – Strongest Potential in Asia
Among Asian currencies, **the Japanese Yen continues to hold the strongest long-term appreciation potential.**  
Although delayed by BoJ policy normalization and rising domestic yields, the Yen should benefit from **natural capital rotation towards safer currencies** as the USD weakens.

## 🔑 Key Takeaways for Long-Term Bias
- The **USD remains structurally vulnerable** to future Fed rate cuts.
- **Political risks (Trump)** add short-term volatility.
- If the USD depreciates, **CHF and EUR** are the most attractive defensive currencies.
- **JPY remains the best long-term candidate in Asia.**

---

## 🎯 Conclusion:
This forward guidance strengthens my strategic bias towards:
- **Short USD medium to long-term.**
- **Selective EUR and CHF longs on retracements.**
- **JPY accumulation for long-term safe haven positioning.**
