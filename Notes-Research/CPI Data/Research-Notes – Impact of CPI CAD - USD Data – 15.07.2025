# 📄 Research-Notes – Impact of CPI CAD / USD Data – 15.07.2025

## 🎯 Objective
Clarify the potential impact of today's CPI releases (Canada and USA) on CAD and USD currencies, within the context of monitored pairs: USD/JPY and AUD/CAD.

---

## 🇨🇦 **Canada Inflation (CPI CAD)**
### Market Expectations:
- Market anticipates a **deceleration in Canadian inflation**.
- An in-line or below-expectation figure would reinforce a **dovish bias for the Bank of Canada (BoC)**.
- A **higher-than-expected CPI** would support CAD short term, pushing back rate cut expectations.

### 📝 Fundamental Interpretation:
| Scenario          | CAD Impact   | BoC Bias        |
|-------------------|--------------|-----------------|
| CPI > expectations | CAD supported | BoC more patient (less dovish) |
| CPI < expectations | CAD weaker    | BoC more dovish |

**Note:** Annual inflation shows signs of stabilization, favoring a **wait-and-see / dovish medium-term bias.**

## 🇺🇸 **United States Inflation (CPI USD)**
### Expected Data:
| Indicator   | Expected | Previous |
|-------------|----------|----------|
| Core CPI m/m | 0.3%     | 0.1%     |
| CPI m/m     | 0.3%     | 0.1%     |
| CPI y/y     | 2.6%     | 2.4%     |

### 📝 Fundamental Interpretation:
- **Expected higher CPI ➔ bullish signal for USD.**
- Core CPI and CPI m/m at 0.3% confirm strong underlying inflation.
- CPI y/y above expectations ➔ reinforces **hawkish Fed bias**.
- Below expectations ➔ neutral, slight short-term USD pressure.

### 🔑 USD Summary:
| Scenario        | USD Impact  | FED Message             |
|-----------------|-------------|--------------------------|
| CPI > expectations | USD stronger | Hawkish short / medium term |
| CPI = expectations | Neutral      | No immediate change        |
| CPI < expectations | USD weaker   | Slight dovish short-term    |

## 🎯 **Impact on My Monitored Pairs**

### 📌 USD/JPY
- USD strengthened by inflation ➔ bullish short-term bias confirmed.
- JPY structurally weak, no bullish catalysts identified.
- USD/JPY remains biased to the upside if data confirms expectations.

### 📌 AUD/CAD
- CAD neutral to slightly bearish if CPI is in-line or below.
- AUD sensitive to risk-on sentiment post-US CPI (neutral / higher US CPI supports AUD via sentiment).
- Maintain bullish bias on AUD/CAD unless CAD surprises to the upside.

---

## 📌 Synthetic Conclusion
Today's CPI releases are key:
- **USD: bullish bias reinforced if inflation > expectations.**
- **CAD: neutral to slightly bearish unless surprise.**

These figures will shape short-term fundamental biases on **USD/JPY (long bias)** and **AUD/CAD (long bias).**
